    additional string-valued keyword arguments ("first" and "second" are
    such arguments in the case of this function), which will come from
    the --redOpts and --blueOpts command-line arguments to capture.py.

    any extra arguments, so you should make sure that the default
    behavior is what you want for the nightly contest.
